## Web Scraping: Amazon PC Monitors Data  

**Public Repository**: [Amazon Monitors Web Scraping](https://github.com/arunabiz/amazon-monitors-web-scraping.git)  

### Project Overview  
This project involves scraping data about computer monitors from Amazon.com, including details such as title, price, rating, reviews, and availability.  

- The data was cleansed to remove sponsored products and out-of-stock items.  
- The final data was saved in a CSV file for further analysis.  
- Two key notebooks are included:
  - `amazon_web_scraping.ipynb`: Initial notebook for scraping a single product.  
  - `amazon_web_scraping_final.ipynb`: Final notebook for scraping all relevant product details.  

**Goal**: To collect information about available PC monitors, including titles, prices, ratings, and the number of reviews.  

### Skills Demonstrated  
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring data accuracy by filtering out irrelevant entries.  
- **Data Analysis**: Exploring and interpreting the collected data.  
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations for insights (e.g., heatmaps, histograms).  
- **Machine Learning**: Training predictive models to analyze customer behavior.  

### Technologies Used  
- **Programming**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (Histplot, Correlation Heatmap)  
- **Machine Learning Tools**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Neighbors Classifier, GaussianNB, Support Vector Machine (SVM), SMOTE, GridSearch  
- **Metrics**: Confusion Matrix, Classification Report  

### Results  
By building machine learning models using feature-rich data, I successfully predicted customer return behavior with 97% accuracy, identifying potential customer churn.
