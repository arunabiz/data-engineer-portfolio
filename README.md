Amazon PC moniotors data web scrape
Code: Amazon PC moniotors data web scrape

Description: This project Computer monitors data from Amazon.com is scraped. Details scraped were title, price, rating, reviews, and availability. Then data was cleansed to get rid of sponsored products and products that are out of stock and saved into a CSV file.

"amazon_web_scraping_final.ipynb" file is the final notebook that was used to scrape all the relevant products details.

Goal: To scrape PC available moniors titles, prices, ratings, and the number of reviews

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, confusion matrix, balancing data, data scaling, machine learning, predictive models

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Histplot, Correlation Heatmap, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Neighbors Classifier, GaussianNB, Support Vector Machine, SMOTE, GridSearch

Results: predicted customer return behavior using machine learning models trained on feature-rich data, achieving an accuracy of 97% in determining potential churn.
