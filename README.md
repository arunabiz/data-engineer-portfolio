## Web Scraping: Amazon PC Monitors Data  

**Public Repository**: [Amazon Monitors Web Scraping](https://github.com/arunabiz/amazon-monitors-web-scraping.git)  

### Project Overview  
This project involves scraping data about computer monitors from Amazon.com, including details such as title, price, rating, reviews, and availability.  

- The raw data was collected using web scraping techniques.
- The data was cleaned to remove sponsored products and out-of-stock items.
- The cleaned data was saved into a CSV file for further use and analysis.
- Two key notebooks are included:
  - `amazon_web_scraping.ipynb`: Initial notebook to test web scraping on a single product.  
  - `amazon_web_scraping_final.ipynb`: Finalized notebook to scrape details for all relevant products. 

**Goal**: To create a dataset of available PC monitors, focusing on key attributes such as title, price, ratings, and customer reviews.
  
### Skills Demonstrated  
- **Web Scraping**: Extracting data from dynamic web pages using automation.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing irrelevant or incomplete entries for a more accurate dataset.
- **Data Analysis**: Interpreting trends in monitor prices, ratings, and reviews 
- **Data Visualization**: Summarizing the data using charts and graphs for better insights.

### Technologies Used  
- **Programming**: Python  
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - Beautiful Soup: For parsing and extracting HTML content.
  - Requests: For sending HTTP requests to Amazon.
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visual insights.

### Results  
The project successfully scraped and analyzed data on PC monitors from Amazon. While machine learning was not a part of this specific project, the processed dataset is well-prepared for potential predictive modeling or deeper analysis in the future.
